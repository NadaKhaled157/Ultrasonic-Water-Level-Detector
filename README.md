# Ultrasonic-Water-Level-Detector
A water-level detector using an ultrasonic sensor. The sensor is fixed above our tank and can detect water level based on the time it takes for a wave to reflect off of the water's surface. There are three different water levels (high-medium-low). Each level has a designated led, and if the water level is low, user is alerted using a buzzer.
